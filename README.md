# Newbie
#### By Ash Laidlaw

### Description

Newbie is a site dedicated to helping newcomers or visitors to a city or other destination experience everything on a more local level. While we all appreciate tourist destinations such as the Empire State Building, Space Needle, Voodoo Doughnuts, or the Golden Gate Bridge, sometimes it's much more rewarding to meet and hang out with locals. Local hole-in-the-wall restaurants, bars, going for bike rides, etc. can be a lot of fun, and the goal of this site is to help locals and out-of-towners connect.
